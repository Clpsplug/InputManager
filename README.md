# Input Manager

**WARNING!**: This plugin is not stable yet!!

This plugin for Unity3D is the wrapper for Unity's New Input Manager.  
With this plugin, you can:

* Handle key presses as your custom `enums`
* "Hold frame count" with small effect from framerate fluctuation
* Rebinding the assigned key (i.e., key config.)
    * Output the custom bindings as serializable dictionary format
    * "Duplicate keys" detection; if rebind causes one key bound to two actions, the plugin will try to swap the binds between them instead

# How to use?

Please see the [README inside the package](Packages/com.clpsplug.input-manager/README.md).
